    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade cheesy garlic bread is so buttery, garlicky, cheesy, and delicious, that it just might steal the show from the lasagna!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon water</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoom pepper</li>
        <li>1 (18-20 inch) baguette or loaf of french bread, sliced in half horizontally</li>
        <li>1&frac12; cup shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400.</li>
        <li> In a small nonstick skillet, cook the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the butter and water over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is straw colored, 7-10 minutes. It is important to keep the heat low or the garlic will burn and turn bitter. The garlic should be lightly browned but not burned!</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, place the remaining 7 tablespoons softened butter and the salt and pepper. Mix in the hot garlic mixture and stir to combine. Using a rubber spatula, spread the butter mixture on the cut sides of bread. Sandwich the bread back together and wrap the loaf in foil.</li>
        <li>Place the wrapped loaf on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and turn the oven to the broil setting.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the bread with the shredded cheese. Broil until cheese has melted and bread is crisp, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the bread to a cutting board with the cheese side facing down.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>I used a blend of Parmesan and mozzarella and my aunt uses just Parmesan â€“ you can tailor this to what you have on hand but I think a mix of white cheeses would be best.</p>
